# INTRUDER-ALARM-USING-ULTRASONIC-PIR-BUZZER
The proposed system integrates ultrasonic sensors to create a protective perimeter around the secured area. These sensors emit high-frequency sound waves and measure their reflection time to detect any changes in the environment. When an intruder enters the monitored zone, the altered ultrasonic signal triggers the system to initiate further security measures.

Among the myriad of available technologies, the integration of ultrasonic sensors, Passive Infrared (PIR) detectors, and a buzzer stands out as a comprehensive approach to intrusion detection.
